## About me

Hello, Muhammad Kemal Idris (A.K.A MrKmall) here. A curious person that want to catch his dreams.

I have graduated from a Vocational School at Bogor City, Jawa Barat Indonesia studying Computer and Network Engineering.
Now crossing the workline from "Hardware Based" to "Software Based".

After following some online lectures and joining a few programmer bootcamp, now I'm working as a software tester.
For almost two years of experience, mostly doing manual testing but I can do automation testing too with Katalon Studio.

I like to know more about a new tech, especially on software testing and gain hands-on experience by doing a test of some application program and joining beta or alpha test of a mainstream work such as Windows 11.
Polishing myself more in the process of my career as a software tester.
